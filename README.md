### File Structure

```

├── index.html      # Main HTML structure
├── style.css       # All styling and animations

## Usage

### View Strains

- Browse all strains in the main list view
- Each entry shows thumbnail image, type badge, name, and source
- Tap any entry to view full details with large image

### Search

- Use the search bar at the top to filter strains
- Searches across name, type, source, and setting fields

### Add New Strain

- Tap the **+** button in the top right
- Fill in the strain details (including optional image URL)
- Tap **Save** to add it to your collection

### Edit Strain

- Open a strain's detail view
- Tap the **Edit** button
- Make your changes and tap **Save**

### Navigate

- Use the **←** back button to return to the list
- Bottom navigation bar provides quick access to main views

## Data Storage

- **Primary**: DigitalOcean API - All CRUD operations sync to cloud database
- **Cache**: LocalStorage - Backup cache for offline access
- **Fallback**: `strains.json` - Initial seed data if API is empty
- **Sync**: Real-time sync across devices when connected to API
- **Offline**: Full offline support with LocalStorage fallback

### Resetting Your Data

**Clear Local Cache:**

1. Open DevTools (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Type: `localStorage.removeItem('smokestack_strains')`
4. Press Enter, then refresh

This clears your local cache and reloads from the DigitalOcean API. If the API is empty, it falls back to `strains.json`.

See [CLEAR_LOCALSTORAGE.md](CLEAR_LOCALSTORAGE.md) for detailed browser-specific instructions.

## Customization

### Colors

Edit the CSS variables in `style.css`:

```css
:root {
  --olive-green: #6b8e23;
  --sativa-green: #4caf50;
  --indica-purple: #9c27b0;
  --hybrid-blue: #2196f3;
  /* ... more colors */
}
```

### Images

Images are currently loaded from hardcoded URLs. To integrate with Cloudinary or another CDN:

1. Add your image URL in the strain form
2. For Cloudinary: Upload images via Cloudinary's API and use their URL format
3. Images are stored as simple URL strings in the data structure
4. Thumbnails (60x60) and detail images (up to 250px height) are automatically sized

**Example Cloudinary URL:**

```
https://res.cloudinary.com/your-cloud/image/upload/w_300,h_300,c_fill/v1234567890/strain-name.jpg
```

### Adding More Fields

1. Update the HTML form in `index.html`
2. Add corresponding fields in `script.js` form handler
3. Update the detail view to display new fields
